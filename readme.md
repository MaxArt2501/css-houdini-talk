The tricks of Houdini: a wagic wand for the future of CSS
=========================================================

Slides for a talk about Houdini. # slides, about 40 minutes.

Originally conceived for the [Codemotion Milan 2018](https://milan2018.codemotionworld.com/speaker/4243/) in Milan, 2018-11-29/30.

Built on top of [P-Slides](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/p-slides)!

## Building

Node.js 10.x is required (actually it could work in Node 8 - haven't checked). This presentation *only works in Chrome **Canary** (v72) only!* Or a browser that supports enough Houdini.

(I pinky-promise I'll update this presentation to new Houdini specs and support as they come.)

To start the presentation in development mode:

1. Clone the repository;
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run serve`

Or `npm run build` to just build it, then serve `/public` with your HTTP server of choice.

## Tests

... what?
